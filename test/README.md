# Roadmap

Here is a list of todo's I am eventually going to cover.

- [ ] Make a flag `places create --source=zoxide` to create the places yaml from whatever zoxide has been recording
- [ ] Have a `default.yaml` under the configuration directory to drop into
- [ ]`config up` a session from a config file
- [ ]`config show` config file well formatted
- [ ]`config load` the config file to my current attached session
- [ ]`config create --source` config file from session name
- [ ]`config archive --save` config files into templates directory
- [ ]`config archive --set` bring a local grem file from something in the archive
- [ ] Build a TUI to manage your configuration files
